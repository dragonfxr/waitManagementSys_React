Week1:
Group formed and named. Selected Scrum Master. Created the Jira Site. Decided on the topic with other group members. Done some brainstorming on what the novel functions will be. 
We also decided to split the group into two sub-groups and work on front end and back end separately.
I'm the scrum master

Week 2:
We selected the framework that will be used in both front end and back end. We have started to build a very simple interface as a try, but haven't make it work yet.
We have discussed the novel functions and comfirmed with the tutor.
